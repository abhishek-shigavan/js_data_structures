1)  Array Problems  :

            I)  LargestSmallestWithSorting.js  :  Generating 10 3-digit random numbers & storing it in array. Sorting the array & then displaying 2nd largest & 
                                               smallest no present in array
                                               
            II)  LargestSmallestWithoutSorting.js  :  Generating 10 3-digit random numbers & storing it in array. Then displaying 2nd largest & smallest no present 
                                                   in array without sorting it
                                                   
            III)  PalindromeArray.js  :  Storing the digit that are repeated twice like 11,22,33.... into the array & displaying the array
            
            IV)  PrimeFactorsArray.js  :  Computing the prime factors of given no & storing it in array & displaying it
            
            V)  Triplet.js  :  Finding the triplet in array & displaying it
            
            
2)  Map Problems  :
            
            I)  DiceGameSimulation.js  :  Rolling dice multiple times & storing the results into map using dice no as a key & its occurence as its value.
                                          Tracking the count of occurence of dice no. Stop the simulation as winning condition (i.e 10 occurence) reaches.
                                          Finally Displaying maximum & minimum time occure dice no.
